Retrieving and sharing photos of specific people from your iPhone is a tedious process in which you need to manually browse your entire photo library and select the desired photos. 
Wouldn't you love an app in which you could, let's say, with a couple of touches, get all photos of yourself and Melissa clicked in San Fransisco? 

Retriev helps you do just that! 
It allows you to tag people in your photos directly from the contact list of your iPhone and makes the retrieval process for photos much easier and faster. 

Retriev has the following features: 
Face Detection in Photos 
Tagging people from contact list 
Geo-Location based tagging 
Quick Retrieval based on name(s) and/or city 
Sharing via Facebook 
Creation of a Video Collage
